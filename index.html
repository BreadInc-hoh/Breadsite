        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, we are bread inc. We supply Bread to Hastings On Husdon, 
            and <em>only</em> Hastings On Hudson. Our small team of four people 
            makes the best bread at a resonable price. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Our Breads</h2>
        <p>
            Here are some of our best breads:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic loaf of Bread</li>
            <p style="text-indent: 2.5%;">
                The basic bread is a perfect size for 1 to 4 people.
                Although simple, is an all around loaf with a crisp crust 
                and many uses. Make a sandwich using it, or just eat it toasted 
                with butter. Got a favorite soup or dip? Soak the bread in it to 
                your hearts content.
            </p>
            <li>Bagguettes</li>
            <li>White Bread</li>
        </ul>
